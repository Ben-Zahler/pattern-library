# Carousel

Every child is rendered as a slide. Only one child is visible at one time.

## Properties

### autorotatedisabled

This Boolean attribute specifies if the slides will not automatically rotate.

### autorotatetime

This number specifies the milliseconds the slides will automatically rotate.

### keysenabled

This boolean attribute specifies if the keyboard navigation (left/right keys) should be enabled.

## Child Elements

Do not set more than ~100 child elements. Otherwise, because of height-calculation costs performance will suffer.
