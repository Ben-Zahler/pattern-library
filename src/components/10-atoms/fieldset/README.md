# Fieldset

The &lt;axa-fieldset&gt; is used to group several controls within a web form. Compared to its native HTML counterpart, its function is restricted to styling: the element ensures that the grouped controls
obey correct spacing as per the style guide. By default, the element children's layout direction is vertical.

## Properties

Unless otherwise noted, properties can be set via attributes or properties.
Starred property names are reflected to attributes.

### horizontal\*

Boolean `horizontal` changes the layout direction of the element's children to horizontal (default: false).
