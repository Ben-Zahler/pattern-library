# Code of Conduct (BETA) @ Patterns Library

## How we communicate with each others
If we speak about something, we should all understand the same thing. Use dictionary and Semantic studies for clear and effective communication. We base our ideas on Alfred Korzybski: [Link Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski).

We make decisions purely based on Democracy. Majority wins.

We don't aim to discuss about every little thing over and over again but, instead, **we suggest, define and use conventions**.

We don't aim to define or make precise every single term we need for our daily work, but assume a shared common-sense understanding throughout. Only when we run into misunderstandings that affect our work, we may take time to make precise what caused the misunderstanding and hampers our work.

We document everything that is relevant for other developers

## Our coding agreements
We talk a lot about the same thing, lets define here what we agreed on so that we wont loose time on the same thing. This is decidede democratically and once approved, personal opinions are ignored.

We make sure that our code respects **ESlint, StyleLint and EditorConfig** settings. We can challenge the setting but wont add our own code style if it goes against linting files.

## Our Pull Request culture
We love to give and receive Feedbacks on our PRs. Every Feedback is legitimit.

If we comment on a Pull Request, **we provide always an explanation on our feedback**. If possible, we also provide reference links. Great would be also adding a coding help snippet. Just always give as much help as possible, to smother enable the PR creator.

In a PR we avoid to change established conventions. We will challenge it in a separate meeting.

**A PR should be merged as soon as possible and not be a place for comprehensive conversation**. If a conversation gets too intensive finish it bilaterally and offline. After agreement is done, we write it down and reference it in the PR.

**We always respects each others opinion as every opinion is valid**. The better idea always wins, even if it comes from an apprenticeship or from a CTO. If a clash on opinion happens, we discuss it in a constructive way.

We assume that a PR creator knows Standard HTML, CSS and JS. We wont explain basics in a PR but are very happy to help verbally and bilaterally those new future frontend heroes. Everyone of us started from the beginning and helping someone is a honor for us.

An example of constructive conversation can look like:

* DONT: This is wrong, here the link to specs
* DO: I'd like to refer to our coding style defined in our XXX, here, this xxxx would be correct because of...

**We aim to be as efficient as possible.** On a PR review, we try to explain before referring to specs as we assume everyone have read the specs but maybe not understood it. We use link to specs as a nice add-on, not as a minimum argument. Of course, if explanation requires lots of time, just referring to specs might be ok. As a rule of thumb, always choose the option that solves the PR creators issue as soon as possible, as we have as goal to merge a PR as quick as possible. We also assume that everyone is willing to learn. Teaching is very welcome but is based on good will.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at luca.mele@axa-winterthur.ch. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
